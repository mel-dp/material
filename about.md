Ashley Jade is a lover of contemporary romance, erotica, new adult, dark romance, oxford commas, the em dash, peanut butter on her cookies, coffee, and anything thought provoking...except for math. 
She's always read books growing up and after having a strange dream one night; she decided to just go for it and publish her first series. 

Little did she know— she would end up falling head over heels in love with writing.

If she's not paying off student loan debt, working, or writing a novel—you can usually find her listening to music, hanging out with her readers online, and pondering the meaning of life. 

Check out her amazon page and Facebook page for future novels.
She recently became hip and joined Twitter, so you can find her there, too. 

She loves connecting with her readers—they make her world go round'. 


~Happy Reading~
